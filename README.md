ShopsRUs Retail Store Discounts

ShopsRUs is an existing retail outlet. They would like to provide discount to their customers on all their web/mobile platforms. They require a set of APIs to be built that provide capabilities to calculate discounts, generate the total costs and generate the invoices for customers

The following discounts apply:
1.	If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
2.	If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
3.	If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
4.	For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount).
5.	The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.
6.	A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.

Write a program in a programming language of your choice with test cases such that given a bill, it finds the net payable amount. Create an RESTful API which when given a bill it returns the final invoice amount including the discount. Please note the stress is on object oriented approach and test coverage. User interface is not required.
